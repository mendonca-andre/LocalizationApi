ASP.NET Core Localization API

To serve people from any culture who use any language, most web applications nowadays have localization support.

Localization is a process that translates content for a specific culture. It can be used to serve a multilingual, worldwide audience and achieve better market reach.

This example shows how to use localization in an ASP.NET Core web API with resource (.resx) files.
